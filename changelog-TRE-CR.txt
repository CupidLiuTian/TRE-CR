*******************change history for TRE-CR****************************

Our TRE-CR project is developed based on CRAC which is a checkpoint and restart architecture for CUDA, link is :
https://github.com/JainTwinkle/CRAC-early-development

In our project, we mainly do the following changes involving new features support, performance optimization and bug fix.

The main change can be summarized as below : 

1) we optimize writing files time consumption during checkpointing stage by adopting NVComp(Nvidia Compress ) library and 
   incremental method so that greatly decrease the checkpointing time overhead.
2) we fix the memory consistency problems by using GEMM(General Matrix Multiplication) strategy.
3) we support CUDA multi-thread function in checkpointing solution so that enhance the runtime efficiency of checkpointing 
   GPU applications.
4) we optimize the locking mechanism which also decrease the runtime overhead during checkpointing process.
5) we support timing algorithm which is a kind of dynamic checkpointing interval adjustment strategy proposed by our team.
6) we support NCCL(NVIDIA Collective Communications Library)-related API and interface which ensure the correct checkpointing of 
   NCCL-based applications.
